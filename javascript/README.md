## 🎓 How to Use This Guide

### For Complete Beginners:
1. **Follow the order**: Start from Phase 1 and progress sequentially
2. **Practice each example**: Type out the code, don't just read it
3. **Draw the diagrams**: Understanding visual representations is crucial
4. **Do the exercises**: Each phase has practice problems
5. **Review mistakes**: Learn from common errors before making them

### For Interview Preparation:
1. **Focus on Phases 5-9**: Advanced concepts and interview questions
2. **Practice problem-solving**: Phase 10 teaches you how to think
3. **Time yourself**: Practice coding under pressure
4. **Explain your code**: Practice talking through your solution

### The Why-What-How Approach:
Each concept is explained using:
- **Why**: Why does this concept exist? What problem does it solve?
